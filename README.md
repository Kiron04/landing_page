Landing Page Project;

Background:

This project will test my skills by creating a website from scratch. For this project I have been given two images. One image shows what the finished project should look like. And the second image has some information on what font sizes and colours have been used within the website. 

This project will allow me to show off the skills I have learned so far in my Odin Project Journey, mainly the flexbox method as I want to be able to create well designed and functional websites in the future.
